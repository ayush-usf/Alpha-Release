### Background and Motivation: 

The police officers work hard every day to keep our city safe. Despite the measures taken by the police department, the disturbing elements in the society keep on carrying out their deleterious deeds that disturbs the peace and tranquility of the community. 

The objective of this project is to help the police department to gain insights about incidents carried out in the past and predict the crime based upon the patterns in dataset.
